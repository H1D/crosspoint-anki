# Dictionary

Look up words while reading an EPUB using an offline StarDict dictionary stored on the SD card.

## Supported Format

The reader supports **StarDict** dictionaries. When searching for dictionaries online, look for "StarDict format" or files with `.dict`, `.idx`, and `.ifo` extensions.

A dictionary folder must contain:

- `.idx` — word index (required, **must be uncompressed** — a `.idx.gz` will not work; decompress it on your computer with `gzip -d` first)
- `.dict` or `.dict.dz` — definition data (`.dict.dz` is supported as-is; entries are decompressed on the fly during lookup)
- `.syn` — synonym index (optional; maps alternate spellings and irregular forms to their headword)
- `.ifo` — metadata (optional)

Not supported: dictionaries with 64-bit index offsets (`idxoffsetbits=64` in the `.ifo` — rare, and rejected with an error).

## Setting Up a Dictionary

1. Copy your dictionary folder(s) to `/dictionaries/` on the SD card — one dictionary per folder, e.g. `/dictionaries/webster/webster.idx` + `webster.dict.dz`. A hidden `/.dictionaries/` folder (dot-prefixed) works the same way, for keeping it out of the file browser.
2. Open **Settings → Reader → Dictionary** on the device.
3. Select a dictionary from the list, or **None** to disable lookups.

The Dictionary setting only appears when at least one usable dictionary folder exists. Folders containing more than one dictionary (multiple `.idx` stems) are skipped as ambiguous.

### Several Languages

Keep one dictionary per book language on the card (say `wikdict-en-ru` and `wikdict-nl-ru`) and select any of them in Settings. Each book is looked up in the dictionary for its own language, taken from the EPUB's metadata; the selected dictionary is used when the book declares no language or no dictionary matches it. **None** turns lookups off for every book.

A dictionary's language comes from, in this order: a `lang=` line in its `.ifo` (`lang=nl` or `lang=nl-ru`, first code = the headword language), the `(nl-ru)` at the end of its title (WikDict and FreeDict dictionaries), or an `nl-ru` / `nl_ru` pair at the end of the folder name. Add a `lang=` line to the `.ifo` of a dictionary that has none of these.

## Looking Up a Word

Two ways to start a lookup while reading:

- Open the reader menu (**Confirm**) and choose **Look Up**.
- Or set **Settings → Controls → Long-press Menu** to "Dictionary", then hold **Confirm** (~0.4s) on the reading page.
- On touch devices, long-press a word on the page. (With an Anki account enabled, this opens "Add to Anki" instead.)

One word on the page becomes highlighted:

1. Use **Left/Right** to move between words in reading order, and the side **Up/Down** buttons to jump between lines.
2. Press **Confirm** to look up the highlighted word.
3. Press **Back** to return to the reader.

On the very first lookup with a dictionary (and again whenever the `.idx` or `.syn` source file changes), the reader shows *"Indexing dictionary…"* while it builds small sidecar files next to them — a `.qidx` for the word index, and a `.sidx` when a `.syn` synonym file is present. Each sidecar is rebuilt independently, only when its own source changes. This takes a few seconds for large dictionaries and makes all subsequent lookups fast. The sidecars can be deleted safely at any time — they will simply be rebuilt.

### How Lookup Works

1. **Direct match** — the word is found as-is (case-insensitive) in the dictionary index. Surrounding punctuation is ignored. For Dutch dictionaries, irregular verb forms are resolved first (`liep` → `lopen`, `was` → `zijn`, `kwam` → `komen`); when the form is also a word of its own (`was` = wax, `vroeg` = early), its entry follows the verb's.
2. **Synonyms** — on a miss, if the dictionary ships a `.syn` file, alternate spellings and irregular forms recorded there are resolved to their headword (e.g. `oxen` → `ox`, `colour` → `color`). This step is skipped if the `.sidx` sidecar could not be built (e.g. transient low memory during indexing); the dictionary otherwise stays usable, and the build is retried the next time it is opened.
3. **Stemming** — still no match: common word forms of the dictionary's language are retried automatically.
   - Dutch: plurals and diminutives (`bomen` → `boom`, `huizen` → `huis`, `balletje` → `bal`), adjective and comparison endings (`grote`, `groter`, `grootste` → `groot`), and verb forms (`loopt` → `lopen`, `werkte` → `werken`, `gezegd` → `zeggen`).
   - Every other language: English possessives and plurals (`dogs` → `dog`, `stories` → `story`) and verb endings (`walked` → `walk`, `running` → `run`, `making` → `make`).
4. **Not found** — a short popup appears and you return to word selection.

## The Definition Screen

When a word is found, the definition screen shows the matched headword at the top and the definition text below, with a page counter for long definitions. A headword with several entries (noun and verb, say) shows all of them.

WikDict dictionaries are shown in a compact form: the part of speech, then one line per meaning, *explanation* — translations. The pronunciation is left out; the reader fonts cannot draw its phonetic symbols.

HTML dictionaries that declare `sametypesequence=h` use the EPUB text-layout engine for semantic formatting such as headings, bold, italics, lists, and line breaks. Images and CSS styling are ignored. Definitions that are too large or cannot be laid out within the available memory fall back to plain text.

- **Left/Right** or side **Up/Down** — previous / next page
- **Back** — return to word selection
